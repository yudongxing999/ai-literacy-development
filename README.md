Personalized Learning System
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Personalized Learning System. The system collects data from learning management systems (LMS), mobile apps, AI assistants, and assessments, analyzes this data to generate insights, and provides decision support for personalized teaching interventions. It aims to optimize learning outcomes by tailoring educational resources and strategies to individual learners.
Features

Data Collection: Gathers learning data from multiple sources including LMS, mobile apps, AI assistants, and assessments.
Data Analysis: Performs descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analyses to uncover learning patterns and generate insights.
Decision Support: Transforms analysis results into actionable teaching decisions and recommendations, including learning reports, intervention suggestions, and resource recommendations.
Teaching Implementation: Executes personalized teaching interventions by adjusting learning resources, optimizing teaching strategies, and providing targeted learning support.

The system is structured into four main modules:

DataCollector: Collects data from various sources.
DataAnalyzer: Analyzes the collected data to generate insights.
DecisionSupport: Provides actionable recommendations based on the analysis.
TeachingImplementation: Implements the personalized teaching strategies.

The main class PersonalizedLearningSystem integrates these modules to provide a complete workflow for personalized learning.
Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
nltk (with 'vader_lexicon')
tensorflow (though not used in the demo)

You can install these using pip:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk tensorflow

Additionally, for nltk, you need to download the 'vader_lexicon':
import nltk
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')

Usage
This project is written in Python 3.x. Ensure you are using Python 3 when running the script.
To run the demonstration of the system:

Ensure all dependencies are installed.
Run the script:

python personalized-learning-system.py

The demo will process a simulated user and display a summary of the results, including intervention suggestions, resource adjustments, strategies applied, and support activities.
For actual deployment, you would need to:

Configure the database connection in the DB_CONFIG dictionary with your actual database credentials.
Replace the simulated data collection methods with real API calls or database queries to fetch actual data from LMS, mobile apps, AI assistants, and assessment systems.

Logging
The system logs all activities to "personalized_learning_system.log" and the console. Ensure you have write permissions for the directory where the script is run.
Note
This is a demonstration version using simulated data. For real-world application, integration with actual data sources is required.
